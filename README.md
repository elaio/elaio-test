# Map Widget CARTO

This project is a code test for a front-end position in CARTO. It has been developed using Vanilla JavaScript and written in ES6.

## Setup

No framework was needed to build this tiny project, and one of the main purposes was to use only a few libraries, which are listed below.

1. Install node-canvas

In order to be able to import leaflet, we are going to use leaflet-headless. Therefore, we must have node-canvas previously installed in our machine.

2. Instal npm packages

Once node-canvas is successfully installed, we will need to install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
gulp
```

## Tests

```
npm test
```
